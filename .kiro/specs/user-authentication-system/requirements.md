# User Authentication & Authorization System Requirements

## Introduction

The User Authentication & Authorization System provides secure, multi-tenant access control for the Cleansheet platform, supporting both the Job Seeker/Learner product line and the Cleansheet Professional product line. The system must handle multiple user roles, organizational boundaries, and integration with external identity providers while maintaining security best practices.

## Glossary

- **Authentication_System**: The core system responsible for verifying user identity and managing sessions
- **Authorization_Engine**: The component that determines user permissions and access rights
- **User_Profile**: A complete user record containing identity, preferences, and role assignments
- **Organization**: A tenant boundary that groups users and controls data access
- **Role**: A named set of permissions that can be assigned to users
- **Session_Manager**: The component responsible for maintaining secure user sessions
- **Identity_Provider**: External authentication services (Microsoft, LinkedIn, Google)
- **Multi_Factor_Authentication**: Additional security verification beyond username/password
