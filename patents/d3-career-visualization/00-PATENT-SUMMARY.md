# Patent Application Summary: D3 Career Visualization System

## Application Details
**Title:** Interactive Career Portfolio Visualization System Using Fixed-Node D3 Trees with Bidirectional Competency Tagging

**Application Type:** Provisional Patent Application
**Filing Entity:** Cleansheet LLC
**Inventor(s):** Cleansheet LLC
**Date Prepared:** January 15, 2025

## Innovation Summary
This patent covers a novel system for visualizing career portfolios using an interactive D3.js tree structure with fixed-node positioning and bidirectional competency tagging. The system creates navigable knowledge graphs connecting career experiences, narrative stories, and portfolio items through tagged competency relationships.

## Key Technical Claims
1. **Bidirectional Career Knowledge Graph** - Data structure linking experiences ↔ stories ↔ portfolio items
2. **Fixed-Node D3 Tree Layout** - Deterministic positioning using .nodeSize() instead of force simulation
3. **Controlled Expansion Interface** - One-level-at-a-time tree expansion to prevent cognitive overload
4. **Multi-Entry Navigation** - Ability to start exploration from any node type (experience, story, portfolio)
5. **Competency Proof Chains** - Traceable evidence paths connecting skills to artifacts

## Commercial Applications
- Professional networking platforms (LinkedIn alternatives)
- Career coaching and development services
- Recruiting and talent management systems
- Educational portfolio platforms
- Freelancer marketing tools
