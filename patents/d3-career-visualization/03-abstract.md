# Patent Abstract: Interactive Career Portfolio Visualization System

## ABSTRACT

An interactive career portfolio visualization system uses a bidirectional knowledge graph data structure to connect career experiences, narrative stories, and portfolio items through shared competency tagging relationships. The system implements a D3.js tree visualization with fixed-node positioning determined by predetermined vertical and horizontal spacing parameters rather than force-directed simulation. A novel one-level-at-a-time expansion algorithm prevents cognitive overload by automatically collapsing sibling nodes when a user expands a selected tree node. The system enables multi-entry point navigation allowing users to begin exploration from any node type (experience, story, or portfolio) and trace competency proof chains from skills claims to supporting evidence. The visualization maintains deterministic positioning and smooth animated transitions while providing progressive disclosure of career information through an intuitive hierarchical interface. This approach solves significant problems in existing career portfolio systems including fragmented information presentation, inability to trace competency development, and cognitive overload from comprehensive career data display. The system supports responsive design adaptation, lazy loading for large datasets, and integration with external career data sources, making it suitable for professional networking platforms, career coaching services, recruiting systems, and educational portfolio applications.
