# Patent Abstract: Transaction-Level Granular Consent Management System

## ABSTRACT

A transaction-level granular consent management system provides context-sensitive consent capture for individual user interactions in consumer-facing web applications through automatic service type detection and dynamic consent metadata generation. The system analyzes form submission contexts including submit button text, field names, and form identifiers to automatically classify user interactions into service types such as inquiries, erasure requests, profile submissions, and support requests using weighted pattern matching algorithms. Based on detected service type, the system generates transaction-specific consent metadata from service-type templates containing appropriate legal basis mappings, data processing purposes, retention periods, and user rights documentation compliant with GDPR Article 6(1)(a) requirements. Unlike existing site-wide consent management solutions, this invention creates individual consent records for each form submission with unique transaction identifiers, enabling granular user control and comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance. The system integrates seamlessly with existing form submission workflows through minimal code modifications and provides performance optimization through consent template caching and batch processing to minimize overhead for high-volume applications. This approach solves significant problems in existing consent management including lack of transaction-specific granularity, manual consent configuration requirements, poor user experience with repetitive consent banners, and high implementation costs for small businesses. The system supports multiple backend storage systems and provides standardized API interfaces for consent record management, withdrawal processing, and compliance reporting, making it suitable for consumer web applications, SaaS platforms, e-commerce systems, and privacy-focused applications requiring sophisticated consent tracking without enterprise platform complexity.
