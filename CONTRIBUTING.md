## Code Standards

### Design System Compliance

All contributions must adhere to the design system defined in [`DESIGN_GUIDE.md`](DESIGN_GUIDE.md):

**Required:**
1. Use CSS custom properties (`:root` variables)
2. Follow Corporate Professional color palette
3. Use Questrial (headings) and Barlow Light (body)
4. Implement mobile-first responsive design (breakpoint: 768px)
5. Include proper accessibility attributes (WCAG 2.1 AA)
6. Use lowercase-with-dashes for file/asset names

### HTML Standards

```html
<!-- Semantic HTML5 -->
<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>

<!-- Proper heading hierarchy -->
<h1> â†’ <h2> â†’ <h3> (never skip levels)

<!-- Alt text on all images -->
<img src="..." alt="Descriptive text">

<!-- Required meta tags -->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

### CSS Standards

```css
/* Use CSS variables */
:root {
    --color-primary-blue: #0066CC;
    --font-family-ui: 'Questrial', sans-serif;
}

/* Mobile-first media queries */
.element { /* mobile styles */ }

@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .element { /* desktop styles */ }
}

/* BEM-like naming */
.feature-card { }
.feature-card__title { }
.feature-card--active { }
```

### JavaScript Standards

```javascript
// Vanilla JS preferred
document.querySelector('.element');

// Event delegation for dynamic content
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    if (e.target.matches('.dynamic-element')) {
        // Handle click
    }
});

// Error handling
try {
    // Code that might fail
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
}

// Use camelCase for variables/functions
const myVariable = 'value';
function myFunction() { }
```
