# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Cleansheet team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities you find.

   - Severity assessment (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

2. **Steps to reproduce**
   - Detailed steps to demonstrate the vulnerability
   - Include URLs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code if applicable

3. **Potential impact**

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

### Code Security

- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Validate all input** from users and external sources
- **Sanitize output** to prevent XSS attacks
- **Use HTTPS** for all external resources
- **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web application security
- **Keep dependencies updated** and review security advisories

### Data Protection

- **Minimize data collection** - only collect what's necessary
- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest and in transit
- **Implement proper access controls**
- **Follow GDPR and CCPA requirements**
- **Log security-relevant events**

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Use secure authentication** mechanisms
- **Implement proper session management**
- **Enforce least privilege** principle
- **Validate permissions** on all protected resources
- **Use secure password storage** (bcrypt, argon2)

---

## Known Security Considerations

### Client-Side Application

This is primarily a client-side web application with:

- **Static hosting**: Reduces server-side attack surface
- **External dependencies**: Font Awesome, Google Fonts (from CDN)
- **No authentication**: Public content library (corpus)
- **Future features**: Will include authentication and user data

### Current Security Measures

- **Content Security Policy**: To be implemented
- **Subresource Integrity**: To be implemented for CDN resources
- **HTTPS enforcement**: Required for production deployment
- **Input validation**: Implemented on search and filter features
- **XSS prevention**: HTML sanitization on user-generated content

## Security Vulnerabilities We're Interested In

### In Scope

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Authentication/Authorization bypass
- SQL Injection (if applicable)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Security misconfigurations
- Insecure dependencies

### Out of Scope

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security
- Attacks requiring physical access
- Issues in third-party services (report directly to them)
- Issues already reported or known
- Issues in unsupported versions

---

## Disclosure Policy

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure approach:

1. **Private disclosure**: Vulnerability is reported privately
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop a fix
3. **Fix deployment**: We deploy the fix to production
4. **Public disclosure**: We publish a security advisory (typically 90 days after fix)
5. **Credit**: We acknowledge the reporter (with permission)

### When We Disclose

We will publicly disclose security vulnerabilities:

- After a fix has been deployed
- After sufficient time for users to update (typically 90 days)
- Or as agreed with the reporter

### Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published:

- In GitHub Security Advisories
- In release notes
- On our website (cleansheet.info)
